# TOEIC grade analysis
The data was obtained from the results of an elite English class at a university. Moreover, the data has four elite courses and 204 students. This data did not provide because the data included basic student information. The project discusses three concepts as follows:

## [Question 1](/Q1.md) 
The differences in the pre-test, attendance, semester grades, and post-test between students in different elite classes. 

## [Question 2](/Q2.md) 
The correlation between pre-test and post-test scores (listening/reading/total scores must be done separately).

## [Question 3](/Q3.md) 
The differences in the overall responses of the students of different elite classes to the "final questionnaire".
