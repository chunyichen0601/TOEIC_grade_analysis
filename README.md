# TOEIC grade analysis
The data was obtained from the results of an elite English class at a university. The data has four elite courses and 204 students. This data did not provide because the data included basic student information. 

_Pre-test_
| Class | listing_grade | reading_grade | total_grade |
| :---: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
|   A   | 283           | 301           | 283         |
|   B   | 283           | 301           | 283         |
|   C   | 283           | 301           | 283         |
|   D   | 283           | 301           | 283         |

_Post-test_
| Class | listing_grade | reading_grade | total_grade |
| :---: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
|   A   | 283           | 301           | 283         |

|   D   | 283           | 301           | 283         |

_Semester Grades_
| Class | att_rate | Semester_grade | Mid_grade | Final_grade |
| :---: | :------: | :------------: | :-------: | :---------: |

The project discusses three concepts as follows:

## [Question 1](/Q1.md) 
The differences in the pre-test, attendance, semester grades, and post-test between students in different elite classes. 

## [Question 2](/Q2.md) 
The correlation between pre-test and post-test scores (listening/reading/total scores must be done separately).

## [Question 3](/Q3.md) 
The differences in the overall responses of the students of different elite classes to the "final questionnaire".
