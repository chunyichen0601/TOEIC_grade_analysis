# The differences in the pre-test, attendance, semester grades, and post-test between students in different elite classes.
In this part, we want to compare the four classes' population means are different. So, we analyzed this question using *ANOVA*. That statistical method analyzes variances to determine if the means from more than two populations are the same. Moreover, if ANOVA's result is significantly different, we conduct Fisher's LSD test nextly. The Fisher's LSD test to find out exactly which groups are different from each other.

## _Q1.1_ Differences in the pre-tests for students in different elite classes.

| Hypothesis                    | F-value | p-value |
| :---------------------------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| $H_0 : t_A = t_B = t_C = t_D$ | 4.01    | 0.00847 |

Check F-value and p-value from ANOVA, we know the pre-tests score has significant differences between elite classes.

| Class | A      | B      | C      |  D     |
| :---: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Mean  | 367.98 | 339.12 | 318.08 | 299.51 |
| Group | a      | ab     | b      | b      |

## _Q1.2_ Differences in the attendance of students in different elite classes.

| Hypothesis                    | F-value | p-value |
| :---------------------------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| $H_0 : t_A = t_B = t_C = t_D$ | 3.90    | 0.00974 |

Check F-value and p-value from ANOVA, we know the attendance of students has significant differences between elite classes.

| Class | A      | B      | C      |  D     |
| :---: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Mean  | 0.9261 | 0.8372 | 0.9095 | 0.8980 |
| Group | a      | b      | a      | a      |

## _Q1.3_ Differences in the semester grade for students in different elite classes.


| Hypothesis                    | F-value | p-value |
| :---------------------------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| $H_0 : t_A = t_B = t_C = t_D$ | 12.09   | 0.00000 |

Check F-value and p-value from ANOVA, we know the semester grade has significant differences between elite classes.

| Class | A      | B      | C      |  D     |
| :---: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Mean  | 68.41  | 84.84  | 81.00  | 80.23  |
| Group | b      | a      | a      | a      |

## _Q1.4_ Differences in the post-tests for students in different elite classes.

| Hypothesis                    | F-value | p-value |
| :---------------------------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| $H_0 : t_A = t_B = t_C = t_D$ | 1.657   | 0.18    |

Check F-value and p-value from ANOVA, we know the post-tests has **NOT** significant differences between elite classes.

| Class | A      | B      | C      |  D     |
| :---: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Mean  | 370.45 | 356.67 | 332.27 | 330.63 |
| Group | a      | a      | a      | a      |
