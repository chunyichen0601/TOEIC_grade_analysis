# The differences in the pre-test, attendance, semester grades, and post-test between students in different elite classes.
In this part, we want to compare the four classes' population means are different. So, we analyzed this question using *ANOVA*. That is a statistical method that analyzes variances to determine if the means from more than two populations are the same. Moreover, if ANOVA's result is significantly different, we conduct the LSD test nextly.
